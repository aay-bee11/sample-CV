                        I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st Street, on the 11th floor.
                        My name is Patrick Bateman.
                        I'm 27 years old.

                        I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine.
                        In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an icepack while doing my stomach crunches.
                        I can do a thousand now.
                        After I remove the icepack, I use a deep-pore cleanser lotion.
                        In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser.
                        Then a honey-almond bodyscrub.
                        And on the face, an exfoliating gel-scrub.
                        Then I apply an herb mint facial masque,
                        which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.
                        I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol,
                        because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.
                        Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.

                        There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman.
                        Some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me.
                        Only an entity-- something illusory.
                        And though I can hide my cold gaze...
                        and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours...
                        and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable,
                        I simply am not there.
